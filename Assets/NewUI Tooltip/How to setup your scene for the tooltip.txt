Hi and thank you for downloading this asset.

Underneath I will write how to setup the scene :

in the scripts folder you will see 4 scripts.

-simpleTooltipWithText is to be set on your tooltip if you wish for it to have only a Text gameObject as a child and nothing else.

- TooltipSetup is to be added on an empty GameObject in your scene. Then set the GameObject you wish to use as the tooltip in the
"Tooltip Object" entry om the inspector.

- UI_TooltipReceiver is to be added on any UI object that will display the tooltip
This script is to be used with custom Tooltip that do not have the simpleTooltipWithText script
For custom tooltip you might wish to inherit this class to set up your own variables and methods.

- UI_TooltipReceiverWithText is to be added on any UI object that will display a tooltip 
which has the simpleTooltipWithText script.

Of course do not forget to make the tooltip gameObejct the last item in your canvas hierarchy 
so it can be on top of all the other UI elements
